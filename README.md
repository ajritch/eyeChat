# eyeChat
https://eyeChat.ajritch.com
Multi-room chat application in which users can communicate by blinking their eyes.

eyeChat allows users with locked-in syndrome to communicate using just the blinking of their eyes. We have added some extra features to allow users with the ability to use a keyboard to communicate more quickly. This is built off RehabStudio's blink-detect (https://github.com/rehabstudio/blink-detect) and Auduno's headtrackr.js (https://github.com/auduno/headtrackr).
